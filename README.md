# Real-Time Wrong Side Vehicle License Plate Detection

This project demonstrates real-time vehicle and license plate detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) and OpenCV. It processes videos to detect vehicles and license plates, extract bounding boxes and OCR (optical character recognition) for license plate text extraction. The output video is saved to disk, and live detection results are displayed in a resized OpenCV window.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FaisalAhmedBijoy/automatic-license-plate-detection
   ```

2. **Run Vehicle Detection Without GUI**:

   ```bash
      python -m app.license_plate_detection
   ```

   Output video will be saved in the `app/outputs` folder and csv be saved in the `app/outputs` folder.

   | 10    | car  | Wrong  | 0.719564   | 3693 FSG    |


3. **Run Vehicle Detection With GUI**:

   Run the following command to start the FastAPI server and access the web interface:

   ```bash
      python -m app.main
   ```

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access the application.

   Check the API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs` for more details on the available endpoints.

   Another approach is open the `webpage.html` file in your browser to access the web interface.
   The web interface allows you to upload a video file

   The processed video will be saved in the `app/results` folder and the csv file will be saved in the `app/results` folder.

   Server Response:

   ```json
